# Logical Regression

A simple implementation of Logistic Regression algorithm in Python.

## Overview

This repository contains a basic Logistic Regression model built from scratch. It is designed to demonstrate the core concepts behind logistic regression, including hypothesis function, cost function, gradient descent, and prediction.

## Features

- Implementation of logistic regression without using external ML libraries.
- Clear, commented code for educational purposes.
- Example dataset included for testing and validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ncn914491/Logical_regression.git
cd Logical_regression

Install required dependencies (if any):

pip install numpy

Usage

Run the main script to train and test the logistic regression model:

python logistic_regression.py

Modify the dataset or parameters inside the script as needed to experiment.

# AI & ML Internship Task: Logistic Regression

This document tracks the progress of the binary classification task using Logistic Regression.

- [X] **Step 1: Download and Explore Dataset**
  - [X] Find and download the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from a reliable source (e.g., UCI).
  - [X] Load the dataset (likely CSV).
  - [X] Perform initial exploration (check columns, data types, missing values, target distribution).

- [X] **Step 2: Preprocess and Split Data**
  - [X] Separate features (X) and target variable (y).
  - [X] Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - [X] Standardize the features using StandardScaler.

- [X] **Step 3: Train Logistic Regression Model**
  - [X] Initialize a Logistic Regression model.
  - [X] Train the model on the standardized training data.

- [X] **Step 4: Evaluate Model**
  - [X] Make predictions on the test set.
  - [X] Calculate and display the confusion matrix.
  - [X] Calculate and report precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - [X] Calculate and report the ROC-AUC score.
  - [X] Plot the ROC curve.

- [X] **Step 5: Tune Threshold and Explain Sigmoid**
  - [X] Explain the role of the decision threshold.
  - [X] Explore the impact of different thresholds on precision and recall.
  - [X] Plot the sigmoid function and explain its role in logistic regression.

- [X] **Step 6: Answer Interview Questions**
  - [X] Draft detailed answers to all provided interview questions based on ML theory.

- [X] **Step 7: Validate and Document**
  - [X] Review the code for clarity and correctness.
  - [X] Review the explanations and answers for accuracy and completeness.
  - [X] Ensure all required outputs (code, plots, answers) are generated.

- [X] **Step 8: Report and Deliver**
  - [X] Compile all code, plots, and documentation.
  - [X] Send the final deliverables to the user.
